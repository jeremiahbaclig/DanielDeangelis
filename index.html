                <h2>About</h2>
                <h3>I am currently a student at UNF working towards a bachelor’s degree in communication, with a concentration in multimedia production. I am constantly working on personal production projects for both pleasure and to sharpen my skills any way I can. The projects I work on consist of short comedy skits, wedding videography, and music videos.

                    ​
                    
                    Though passion can be a strong word, I certainly do have a love for filmmaking and editing. I have made videos since elementary school, whether it be on my mom’s 1.2-megapixel phone camera or my iPod touch, I have strived to make videos that effect people (hopefully in a positive way). I remember as a child watching movies and feeling nothing when the credits came, which made me upset. I could not understand why at the time, but now I get it. Film is an art form like any other. Sure it can be used to make money, but it can also be used to tell a story that moves someone to the point it changes their life, or at the very least makes them feel something. When my cousin watched her wedding video and started to cry, that solidified my stance on film and what I want to do.
                    
                    
                    
                    Within the next year, I plan on either working with a production studio as a videographer or working as a freelance videographer and film advertisements, music videos, and weddings. I also intend to keep working on personal projects as well, since they keep my skill set fresh. Currently, I have experience with Adobe products like Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and After Effects. I also have quite a bit of experience with camera equipment and lighting gear, though there is always more to learn. Another thing to note is I am tech-savvy, so I have plenty of experience with social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. </h3>

                <h2>Internship</h2>
                <br><h3>During my time at Tandem Studios I was able to learn and in turn successfully perform new filming techniques, as well as learning how to produce different aspects of a project. While interning, I learned different types of shot composition, how to light a scene correctly, how to use different camera settings for different situations, and get overall great insight into the professional world of videography. Not only did I provide a helping hand with the set up for many shots, but I was also allowed to film many as well using a body mounted gimbal and camera set up. </h3>

            <br><br><br><br><h2>About the internship videos:</h2><br><br>
            <h3><strong>5 Sisters Spirit Final</strong> – This video was made for Culhane’s Irish Pub to promote their new 5 Sisters Vodka. This was one of the first projects we worked on with the sisters and one of the first videos made to advertise their vodka. 
                <br><br><strong>Byrne Bros Final</strong> – This project was made for Culhane’s as well to promote their pubs for St. Patrick’s Day. It was made to make the audience feel as if they were in the pub and taking part in the festivities that would come on St. Patrick’s Day.
                <br><br><strong>Aine Edit</strong> – This was one of the 4 videos made for each individual sister regarding their 5 Sisters vodka. The drink Aine makes in the video is not only her favorite, but also presents it with their brand new vodka to promote it to both returning and new customers. 
                <br><br><strong>Tequila’s Town Edit</strong> – This project was an initial advertisement for the establishment Tequila’s Town. This was more of an initial project to see if they were interested in future business ventures with Tandem Studios. </h3>
